      <summary>What is ASClient</summary>
      <p>
        ASClient is a locally ran HTML File / Client for me to run while at school due to the linewise extension not being able to view locally ran HTML Files.
        this is a bypass client to the linewise / classwise extension by using this you get access to many tools and the teachers can't see your screen on THIS html file.
        due be aware it doesnt make it so they cant see your other tabs they just cant view this tab because its a local file.
